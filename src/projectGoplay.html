				<p>
					For our last class we were tasked to make groups of 4 and work on a
					scrum project. For us that project was a dashboard for the backend for
					the site
					<a href="https://www.goplay.be/" target="_blank">Goplay</a> (their
					brand style was different at the time of creating this project) where
					each person had a different role. <br /><br />
					I was git master which meant I was in charge of merging branches and
					fixing any conflicts there were. I also had to fill in the role of
					scrum master a couple of times since the person assigned to it was
					sick for a couple of days. Each of us had a different part of the site
					to work on, I decided I would create the homepage and later on we were
					tasked to create a couple extra pages and I got the settings page.
					<br /><br />
					While working on the homepage I had to create the graphs we created in
					our design and for that I decided to test around a bit with a couple
					of different JavaScript libraries to create them. I eventually settled
					on using multiple libraries for different charts since they each had a
					part in which they were stronger. I also made the setup for the gulp
					project and how to layout our .scss files.
					<br /><br />
					I had a lot of fun creating this project and learned a lot of working
					in a team. The most important part was, in my opinion, helping each
					other with our parts and looking for solutions to problems each of us
					had.
