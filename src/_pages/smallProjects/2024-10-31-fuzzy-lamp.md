<section class="c-project__about">

A simple Python file which reads specific columns from specific rows of data and counts up the different values. Programmed to be used to count different genomes of mice.

I decided to make this little script for a friend that has to do genome mapping and she had a bunch of excel file where she just needed the types of a couple of specific genomes. So instead of having her go through each 50.000 + line long file I created this.
