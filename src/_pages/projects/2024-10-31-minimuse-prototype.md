<section class="c-project__about">

For this project I want to solve a problem I personally have. Looking for references for miniature painting.
Right now I have to switch between reddit, pinterest, instagram, facebook and more or I need to download lower res compressed versions of these images.

So I decided that there needs to be a website where people can upload all of their different miniatures for other people to see.

After working on it for a month I have properly learned the Laravel framework and realized I made a lot of mistakes for the beginning (part of the code has been fully rewritten already). But instead of fixing them and continuing work on this I have decided to keep it around as a prototype for my idea. While working on this I have realized I made a lot of mistakes before even coding back in the design fase. While this isn't a make or break for a lot of sites this does however makes it so I need to redo the entire project from scratch.

I still feel like I have grasped the workings of the Laravel framework and am able to create a fully properly designed website in it.
