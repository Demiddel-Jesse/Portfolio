# Hi, Iâ€™m Jesse Demiddel, a full-stack developer with an affinity for front-end development and animations

My main drive in web development is either translating a design to the screen or solving problems which i find.
Besides coding I also have an avid interest in 3D, VFX and animations.

When not at the computer I enjoy spending my time painting Miniature models, kart racing or since quite recently badminton.
