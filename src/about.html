				<h2>Activities</h2>
				<p>
					While not being a fanatic about sports I've recently started playing
					badminton at a local club.
					<br />
					On other days I like to take walks around the local park which is
					always fun to walk between the trees and near the water.

				<h2>Miniatures</h2>
				<p>
					About a year ago I started with painting a small starter kit of
					Tyranids from 'Games Workshop' because I thought they looked cool and
					really wanted to try my hand at painting miniatures. Since then I've
					been working on painting
					<span>
						2 Warhammer 40K armies (Tyranids &amp; space-marines), A miniature
						tank
					</span>
					and quite recently my <span>first gunpla model</span>. The biggest
					reason I like this hobby is that it's the first time I've attempted a
					creative hobby where I haven't gotten discouraged by being bad at it.
					<span>Every mini is special</span> and while some are clearly a lot
					worse than others I still like to display them next to each other.

				<h2>Racing</h2>
				<p>
					I've been interested in racing since I can remember. Watching F1, and
					recently endurance racing, and learning about the physics around
					aerodynamics and the way the cars were built is what has really
					interested me but the best part about is the insanely close action at
					300+kph between those drivers. <br /><br />
					Currently I'm driving karts monthly at
					<span>worldkarts kortrijk</span> and have been steadily getting
					faster. While not possible at this time I would like to eventually
					start racing in either cars or open wheels or even just a national
					karting championship. <br /><br />
					For extra information as of 27/05/2024 my fastest time at worldkarts
					kortrijk is a <span>1:00.507</span>.
