				<h1>Sinksen 2022 website project</h1>

			<section class="c-project__about">
				<p>
					For our first big project of the degree we had to create a website and
					promotional video for
					<a href="https://www.sinksen.be/" target="_blank">Sinksen</a> for the
					year 2022. <br /><br />
					The first part was obviously designing the entire project. Since the
					theme that year was 'art deco' we had to create a website that fit
					with that style and still feel modern.
					<br /><br />
					After the design was done it was time to start building the website.
					We were also given an api where it we needed to get all the different
					activities from and have the ability to like them. We also had to
					create a leaflet map where you would be able to see the different
					points where things were happening (This api has since gone offline).
					<br /><br />
					Since I was following the video track of my degree I also had to go
					and film on Sinksen itself and then create a video. Our entire class
					had to share footage because it was quite impossible to go and film
					every location by yourself and gather enough intersting footage.
					<br /><br />
					We had to do the editing of the video in Premiere pro and then also
					use copyright free music.
					<br /><br />
					This project had the first big video with both a lot of freedom and
					restrictions in it and I learned a lot from that. Also working with an
					expansive api for the first time was a fun experience and really
					cemented how to perform proper CRUD operations.
