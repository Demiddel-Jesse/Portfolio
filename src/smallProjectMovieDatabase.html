				<p>
					This is my very first full fledged PHP site. Since this was meant as a
					test to assess that I am able to create a functional site in PHP and
					keep the code readable for my course at the VDAB.
					<br /><br />
					I created the site according to the MVC design pattern and had to use
					MySQL for the database. I started with creating the database and
					filled in the data with chatGPT. While creating the database I decided
					to Use paths and locally stored images for the film posters but when
					it came to the images of actors and directors I wanted a bit of a
					challenge since these were optional in my description of the task so I
					saved them as blobs in the database.
					<br /><br />
					I had a couple of problems while reading the blobs from the database
					and setting them in img tags and also while saving images. Since this
					site was meant to have all basic CRUD operations Admins had both the
					ability to create and edit films and actors/directors, while users
					only could create a list for which movies they wanted to watch / have
					watched and give them scores.
					<br /><br />
					My biggest problem came when I wanted to put the site online since I
					decided to use vercel since it's a free platform with little
					restrictions for simple sites. As I put the site online I had to deal
					with routes for the first time and those caused me a lot of headaches
					since there isn't a lot of proper documentation on hosting a PHP site
					on vercel. After figuring it out i had to translate a lot of the sql
					script for the database since I used a lot of things which caused
					errors in PostgreSQL.
