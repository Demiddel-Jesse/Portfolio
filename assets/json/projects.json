                "For our end project of 2022 we had to create a website for the festivities at Sinksen 2022 in Kortrijk. We had to show all activities and have the ability to sort/search through them to find what you want. Next tot that we also needed a map with the location markers for each activity on them plus the services provided by the city. Us video students also had to create a promotional video next to that.",
                "For this we started with designing the entire thing in Adobe XD and creating a storyboard for the video. We then had to go film on Sinksen itself to get footage for the video. Each student had to create their own video but we all shared our footage and had to each film in a specific spot.",
                "Then work started on the website, first building the basics like just the static pages while also creating a raw edit for the video.",
                "After getting approval for the video the final touches on the edit started plus some extra effects, while on the website I started integrating the API content through JS and an API provided by the teachers.",
                "I learned a lot from this project such as time management how to properly edit a video to sound/music and how to connect with an API and make a map with multiple markers from that.",
                "At this point in time the API we used for this has gone down and its contents can't be seen again. I'm slowly building a small JSON file with which i can replace the API data handler. If this has already happend the original code will still be there in the source code but commented with a comment above explaining that this code was used for an API that has since gotten removed."

                "So after we designed everything I got started on the setup of our project ranging from setting up the basic grid and some basic scss files to setting up our gulp so it would work, I decided we would use gulp because I found webpack really annoying to work with but thats mostly because our teachers never showed us an easy way to setup webpack and use it while I had found that with gulp.",
                "After all that was done I started with experimenting with multiple bundles for creating graphs and eventually settled that I would use multiple for different purposes.",
                "Eventually I got all graphs working with good visuals and gave all of them some dummy data. Then I started on the settings screen but for that there wasn't much time left since i found the main dashboard page more important and wanted is as near as perfect as I could.",
                "In the last couple days I helped with the person creating the user management page since I did that design and had made it a bit difficult for him. In the last day he sadly enough pushed a commit which broke a lot of things and I had to spend some time deleting that commit.",
                "I found the working with graphs very intriguing and would have liked it if there was any actual data to read so that it wouldn't just be some gibberish."

                "Then I had to finish up the webshop, for which we used woocommerce to load in the products and stuff. While I got the products to show I was never able to create the filters for reasons I was unable to understand at the time within the timeframe we were allowed to work on features.",
                "I eventually just hardcoded some HTML and CSS for the filters so there is at least a visual representation for them on the page.",

I would like to spend some time learning PHP especially after this but it isn't something I am prioritizing right now.",
